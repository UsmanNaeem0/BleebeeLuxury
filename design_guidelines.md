# Feezish Milk & Honey Skincare Website Design Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
Create a luxurious, modern eCommerce experience blending organic warmth with high-end beauty aesthetics. The design should feel creamy, elegant, and natural with honey gold, milky white, and soft beige tones throughout.

## Typography System
- **Headings**: Playfair Display (serif, luxury feel)
- **Body Text**: Poppins (modern, clean, readable)
- **Hierarchy**: Large serif headlines for impact, clean sans-serif for product information and body content

## Layout & Spacing
- Use generous breathing room between sections
- Rounded edges on all cards, buttons, and containers
- Soft, creamy drop shadows for depth
- Clean alignment with grid-based product layouts
- Mobile: Stack vertically, 2-column product grids

## Core Sections

Fixed top navigation with semi-transparent background and blur effect. Left-aligned Feezish logo (milk drop merged with honey swirl design). Center/right menu items with smooth gold underline animation on hover. Shopping cart icon on far right. "Shop Now" CTA button with honey gradient. Responsive hamburger menu with slide-in panel on mobile.

### 2. Hero Banner

- Honey drip SVG dividers between major sections
- Buttons with smooth glow on hover (not flashy)
- Glass-style section overlays with subtle transparency

## Component Styling
- **Buttons**: Honey gold gradient (#F6C76B → #F0A54D), rounded corners, smooth glow hover
- **Cards**: Rounded edges, soft shadows, clean white backgrounds
- **Inputs**: Rounded borders, warm beige focus states
- **Icons**: Simple line-style icons with honey gold accents

## Images Strategy
- Hero: Large animated honey-milk blend background with floating bee
- About: Honey pouring into milk (video or high-quality image)
- Products: Clean white background product photography with soft shadows
- Categories: Lifestyle images showing product use/ingredients
- Testimonials: Circular customer headshots
- All images should convey warmth, luxury, and organic authenticity

## Responsive Behavior
Fully mobile-optimized. Hero stacks vertically. Product grids become 2-column scrollable on mobile. Navigation becomes hamburger menu. Footer columns collapse into accordions. Maintain generous spacing and readability at all breakpoints.
