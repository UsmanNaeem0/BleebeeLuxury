🐝 Prompt: Feezish — Milk & Honey Skincare Website Inspired by Blebee

Design a luxurious, modern eCommerce website for Feezish, a premium Milk & Honey skincare brand inspired by the Blebee VinovaTheme aesthetic.
The goal: blend organic warmth, creamy textures, and golden honey visuals with a high-end beauty brand feel.

🎨 Theme & Visual Aesthetic

Overall Look: Elegant, warm, and natural — mix of honey gold, milky white, and soft beige tones.

Primary Colors:

Honey Gold: #F6C76B

Cream White: #FFF8E7

Warm Beige: #FDF3E6

Soft Brown Text: #5A4632

Typography:

Headings → Playfair Display (serif, luxury feel)

Body → Poppins (modern, readable)

Background: Gradient blend of milk-white and honey amber with soft lighting and faint honeycomb pattern.

Style: Rounded edges, glowing buttons, smooth transitions, and creamy drop shadows.

Effects: Subtle honey-drip dividers, glass-style sections, and floating animation on hover.

🧭 1. Navigation Bar

Fixed top navigation with semi-transparent background and blur.

Left: Feezish logo (milk drop merged with honey swirl).

Center/Right Menu: Home | Shop | About | Contact | Cart (🛒 icon)

Highlight active menu with gold underline animation.

Hover: Smooth honey glow effect under each menu item.

CTA: “Shop Now” button in honey gradient (#F6C76B → #F0A54D).

Responsive: On mobile, use hamburger menu with slide-in panel.

🍯 2. Hero / Welcome Banner

Inspired by Blebee’s dripping honey banner.

Scene Design:

A soft animated background showing honey and milk splashes blending together.

A cute bee gently flying over creamy milk waves.

Text (animated fade-in):
🐝 “Welcome to Feezish”
“Where nature meets skincare — indulge in the blend of Milk & Honey.”

Buttons:

“Explore Collection” (solid honey gold)

“Shop Now” (outlined with gold border + glow on hover)

Add honey drip animation at the bottom edge of the hero section.

🌼 3. About Section

Layout similar to Blebee’s About Honey section.

Left: Image or short looping video of honey being poured into milk.

Right: Headline: “Nourish Your Skin with Nature’s Purest Blend.”
Paragraph: “Feezish skincare products are crafted with organic milk and golden honey to hydrate, heal, and enhance your natural glow.”

Add soft fade-up animations for the text and images.

🧴 4. Featured Products Section

Just like Blebee’s product grid — 3 or 4 products in a row, minimal clean design.

Section Title: “Our Bestsellers”

Each card includes:

Product image (soft shadow)

Name, short description, price

“Add to Cart” button with golden gradient hover

Hover animation: light shine across product image + soft zoom.

🌸 5. Collections / Shop Categories

Inspired by Blebee’s “Shop by Category” blocks.

✨ Animations

Scroll-triggered fade-ins, slow zooms, and floating elements.

Honeybee has soft looping hover animation path.

Honey drip dividers use SVG animation at section boundaries.

Buttons glow smoothly on hover — not flashy.

📱 Responsive Behavior

Fully mobile-friendly, like Blebee’s Shopify layout.

Hero banner stacks vertically.

Product grid turns into a 2-column scrollable layout on phones.

Footer collapses into accordions.

💅 General Notes

Keep the layout breathable with generous spacing and clean alignment.

Use subtle motion — luxury over exaggeration.

All design should feel creamy, organic, and cohesive with the milk & honey palette.
